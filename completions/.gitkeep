# Completion Scripts Reference

The shell completion scripts in this directory serve as reference documentation.
The actual scripts are embedded in the backlog binary (see src/commands/completion.ts).

During development, the CLI will read these files first if they exist,
otherwise it falls back to the embedded versions.

Files:
- backlog.bash - Bash completion reference
- _backlog - Zsh completion reference  
- backlog.fish - Fish completion reference
- README.md - Installation and usage guide
- EXAMPLES.md - Detailed examples and how it works
