# ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**

1. Read the [README.md](README.md)
2. Please follow the instructions below for instructions on how to work with Backlog.md on tasks in this
   repository [agent-guidelines.md](src/guidelines/agent-guidelines.md)

## Commands

### Development

- `bun i` - Install dependencies
- `bun test` - Run tests
- `bun run format` - Format code with Biome
- `bun run lint` - Lint and auto-fix with Biome
- `bun run check` - Run all Biome checks (format + lint)
- `bun run build` - Build the CLI tool
- `bun run cli` - Uses the CLI tool directly

### Testing

- `bun test` - Run all tests
- `bun test <filename>` - Run specific test file

## Core Structure

- **CLI Tool**: Built with Bun and TypeScript as a global npm package (`@backlog.md`)
- **Source Code**: Located in `/src` directory with modular TypeScript structure
- **Task Management**: Uses markdown files in `backlog/` directory structure
- **Workflow**: Git-integrated with task IDs referenced in commits and PRs

## Code Standards

- **Runtime**: Bun with TypeScript 5
- **Formatting**: Biome with tab indentation and double quotes
- **Linting**: Biome recommended rules
- **Testing**: Bun's built-in test runner
- **Pre-commit**: Husky + lint-staged automatically runs Biome checks before commits

The pre-commit hook automatically runs `biome check --write` on staged files to ensure code quality. If linting errors
are found, the commit will be blocked until fixed.
