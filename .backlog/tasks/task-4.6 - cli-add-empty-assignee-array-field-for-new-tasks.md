## Description

Ensure every task created via the CLI includes an empty `assignee` array in its frontmatter. Investigate the current parsing and serialization logic which uses a single string value. If assignees are not handled as an array, update the code to support `string[]`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] New tasks contain `assignee: []` by default.
- [ ] Parsing and serialization read and write the assignee field as an array.
- [ ] Documentation provides instructions to migrate existing logic if needed.
