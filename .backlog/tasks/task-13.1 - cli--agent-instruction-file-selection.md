## Description

Replace the existing yes/no prompt in `backlog init` with a multi-select menu. Users can choose any combination of the following guideline files to update with Backlog instructions:

- `.cursoreules`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `readme.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `backlog init` displays a multi-select prompt for agent instruction files.
- [ ] Users can select one or more files, or skip entirely.
- [ ] Selected files are created or appended with instructions; unselected files remain unchanged.
- [ ] Automated tests cover the new selection flow.
