## Description

When running the Backlog CLI installed from npm, the compiled executable fails if `blessed` isn't available in the current project. This prevents usage in nonâ€‘JavaScript repositories. Update the build process so that the standalone binary bundles `blessed` and other npm dependencies directly.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Build scripts compile without `--external blessed`
- [ ] CI and release workflows build binaries that include dependencies
- [ ] `backlog` runs globally without installing blessed locally
