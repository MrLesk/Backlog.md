## Description

Conduct a thorough assessment of neo-neo-blessed to understand its API compatibility with the current blessed implementation and identify any breaking changes or differences that need to be addressed during migration.

This research phase will:
- Compare the APIs of blessed vs neo-neo-blessed
- Identify all current blessed usage patterns in the codebase
- Document any breaking changes or API differences
- Assess the impact on existing functionality
- Create a migration plan based on findings

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Review neo-neo-blessed documentation and source code
- [ ] Create a comprehensive list of all blessed API calls used in the project
- [ ] Document any API differences between blessed and neo-neo-blessed
- [ ] Identify potential breaking changes that will require code modifications
- [ ] Test basic neo-neo-blessed functionality in a minimal example
- [ ] Create a migration checklist of required changes
- [ ] Document any features that may need alternative implementations
- [ ] Assess impact on binary packaging and distribution
