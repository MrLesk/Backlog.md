## Description

Set up continuous integration for the CLI. Use GitHub Actions to build the project with Bun, run tests, and publish the package to npm (and by extension Yarn) when a release tag is pushed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Workflow builds the CLI with `bun build` and runs tests
- [ ] Publishing step deploys to npm using `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`
- [ ] Trigger on version tags like `v*.*.*`
- [ ] Documentation updated with release instructions
