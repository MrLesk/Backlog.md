## Feature Request: Jira Bidirectional Sync Plugin

### Problem

Development teams using Backlog.md cannot collaborate with team members who use Jira exclusively. This forces developers to either:
- Manually duplicate work between systems
- Abandon Backlog.md entirely
- Work isolated from the rest of the team

### Proposed Solution

Create a standalone CLI plugin (`backlog-jira`) that enables bidirectional synchronization between Jira and Backlog.md with **zero changes to Backlog.md core**.

### Key Features

**Import from Jira**
```bash
backlog-jira import "project = PROJ AND assignee = currentUser()"
```

**Push Local Changes**
```bash
backlog-jira push 42  # Sync task-42 to Jira
```

**Pull Remote Updates**
```bash
backlog-jira pull 42  # Get Jira updates with conflict detection
```

**Bidirectional Sync**
```bash
backlog-jira sync 42  # Two-way sync with 3-way merge
```

**Watch Mode**
```bash
backlog-jira watch    # Auto-sync on changes
```

### Architecture

- **Standalone CLI**: Separate npm package (`@backlog.md/jira-plugin`)
- **Public APIs Only**: Uses Backlog CLI + MCP Atlassian server
- **Zero Core Changes**: No modifications to Backlog.md codebase
- **Conflict-Aware**: 3-way merge with interactive resolution
- **State Management**: SQLite database in `.backlog-jira/`

### Use Case Example

**Scenario**: Developer on Jira-tracked sprint wants to use Backlog.md locally

```bash
# Import sprint tasks
backlog-jira import "sprint = 42"

# Work locally
backlog task edit 287 -s "In Progress"
backlog task edit 287 --check-ac 1
backlog task edit 287 --notes "Implemented feature X"

# Sync back to Jira
backlog-jira sync 287
```

**Result**: Developer works in Backlog.md, team sees updates in Jira, everyone stays in sync.

### Benefits

- **Enterprise Adoption**: Companies can adopt Backlog.md without abandoning Jira
- **Team Flexibility**: Each member uses their preferred tool
- **Process Integration**: Works with existing Jira workflows
- **Non-Invasive**: Doesn't require changes to Backlog.md core

### Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1** (Week 1): Foundation, config, MCP/CLI integration
2. **Phase 2** (Week 2): Import, push, pull commands
3. **Phase 3** (Week 3): Field mapping, conflict resolution
4. **Phase 4** (Week 4): Watch mode, status display, polish

### Technical Considerations

**Challenges**:
- Conflict resolution between local and remote changes
- Field mapping (different models in Jira vs Backlog.md)
- Real-time sync efficiency
- Custom field support

**Solutions**:
- Git-style 3-way merge with base snapshots
- Configurable field mappings with transforms
- File watchers + polling with smart debouncing
- Dynamic field discovery

### Success Metrics

- Zero changes to Backlog.md core required
- >95% successful sync rate
- <5% manual conflict resolution needed
- <2s sync time per task
- Enterprise team adoption

### Questions for Discussion

1. Bidirectional sync from start, or begin with one-way?
2. How to handle Jira-specific features (sprints, boards)?
3. Should attachments be synced?
4. Separate repo or part of Backlog.md monorepo?
