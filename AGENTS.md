# ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**

Read the [agent-guidelines.md](src/guidelines/agent-guidelines.md)  
When you're working on a task, you should assign it yourself: -a @codex

In addition to the rules above, please follow these guidelines when working on tasks:
1) After you add the implementation plan, ask Gemini CLI to review it by running `gemini "review plan <task-id>"`.
2) After you finish the implementation, ask Gemini CLI to review it by running `gemini "review code <task-id>"`.

## Commands

### Development

- `bun i` - Install dependencies
- `bun test` - Run all tests
- `bunx tsc --noEmit` - Type-check code
- `bun run check .` - Run all Biome checks (format + lint)
- `bun run build` - Build the CLI tool
- `bun run cli` - Uses the CLI tool directly

### Testing

- `bun test` - Run all tests
- `bun test <filename>` - Run specific test file

### Configuration Management

- `bun run cli config list` - View all configuration values
- `bun run cli config get <key>` - Get a specific config value (e.g. defaultEditor)
- `bun run cli config set <key> <value>` - Set a config value with validation

## Core Structure

- **CLI Tool**: Built with Bun and TypeScript as a global npm package (`npm i -g backlog.md`)
- **Source Code**: Located in `/src` directory with modular TypeScript structure
- **Task Management**: Uses markdown files in `backlog/` directory structure
- **Workflow**: Git-integrated with task IDs referenced in commits and PRs

## Code Standards

- **Runtime**: Bun with TypeScript 5
- **Formatting**: Biome with tab indentation and double quotes
- **Linting**: Biome recommended rules
- **Testing**: Bun's built-in test runner
- **Pre-commit**: Husky + lint-staged automatically runs Biome checks before commits

The pre-commit hook automatically runs `biome check --write` on staged files to ensure code quality. If linting errors
are found, the commit will be blocked until fixed.

## Git Workflow

- **Branching**: Use feature branches when working on tasks (e.g. `tasks/task-123-feature-name`)
- **Committing**: Use the following format: `TASK-123 - Title of the task`
