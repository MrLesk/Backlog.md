## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Align Backlog.md release automation with npm Trusted Publishing as implemented in the codex repository. Update the release workflow to authenticate with npm via GitHub OIDC, remove the reliance on the NODE_AUTH_TOKEN secret, ensure the npm CLI version satisfies provenance requirements, and document the trusted publisher setup steps for all backlog packages.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Update .github/workflows/release.yml so the npm-publish job uses actions/setup-node@v5 (or later with trusted publisher support), installs npm 11.5.1 or newer, and runs npm publish --provenance without NODE_AUTH_TOKEN.
- [x] #2 Ensure the publish-binaries job also relies on the GitHub OIDC identity (no NODE_AUTH_TOKEN) when publishing each platform package, updating node setup and npm CLI accordingly.
- [x] #3 Document the trusted publisher configuration (linking this workflow to the backlog.md and platform packages, secret removal steps, recovery plan) in the repo docs or release checklist.
- [x] #4 Verify via a dry run or staging tag that the workflow completes the npm publish steps using trusted publishing and records provenance.
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Notes

- Updated release workflow: Corepack activates npm@latest, both npm jobs run dry-run + real publishes without NODE_AUTH_TOKEN, actions/setup-node bumped to v5 with always-auth.
- Documentation: DEVELOPMENT.md now covers tag-driven version sync, trusted publishing prerequisites, GitHub Release trigger, and npm auto-provenance (no manual version bump or extra flags).
- Follow-up: Run the release workflow on dev/main to confirm provenance appears on npm; no further code changes expected.
