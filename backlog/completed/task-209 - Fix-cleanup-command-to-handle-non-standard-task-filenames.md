## Description

Fixed a bug where the cleanup command would fail when encountering task files that didn't follow the standard naming convention. This affected task-196 which used lowercase and hyphens instead of spaces and Title-Case.

## Implementation Notes

The cleanup command was failing for tasks with non-standard filenames (e.g., 'task-196-add-nixos-packaging-support.md' instead of 'task-196 - Add NixOS packaging support.md'). Updated getTaskPath, getTaskFilename, and getDraftPath functions in src/utils/task-path.ts to handle both naming formats by checking for both 'task-ID -' and 'task-ID-' patterns.
