## Description

Add live updates to the task list and board UIs by watching the local tasks folder with Bun.watch.

Detect and handle: (1) new task files, (2) edits to existing task files, and (3) task removals (moves to completed).

Update only the affected tasks in the UI while preserving any active filters.

Watch is enabled by default in interactive TUI views.

Also extend the local web UI: use a generic watch function in the server to detect changes and broadcast a "tasks-updated" event via WebSocket; the React app listens and triggers a full tasks refresh on receipt.

Scope: local tasks folder.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Use Bun.watch to watch only backlog/tasks (no extra deps)
- [x] #2 On new task file: appears in task list/board without losing current filters
- [x] #3 On task edit: updates the affected task in task list/board without resetting filters
- [x] #4 On task removal (moved out of tasks): disappears from task list/board; selection remains sensible
- [x] #5 Avoid full dataset reload on single-file events (incremental refresh)
- [x] #6 Watch is enabled by default in interactive TUI views
- [x] #7 Create a generic watcher utility shared by TUI and server
- [x] #8 Server uses watcher and broadcasts 'tasks-updated' via WebSocket
- [x] #9 React app listens for 'tasks-updated' and triggers a full tasks refresh
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

Implemented shared Bun.watch-based task watcher utility used by TUI and server. TUI unified view performs incremental updates for add/change/remove without losing filters; server broadcasts 'tasks-updated' via WebSocket; React listens and triggers full refresh. Verified via tests; no regressions observed.
