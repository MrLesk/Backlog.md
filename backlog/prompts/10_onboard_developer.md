A new developer is joining the team. Provide them with an onboarding guide by performing the following steps:

1.  List all documents in `backlog/docs/` by reading the directory.
2.  List all decisions in `backlog/decisions/`.
3.  Provide a list of 3-5 "good first tasks" from the backlog. These should be tasks that are in "To Do" status, have a "low" or "medium" priority, and have no dependencies. Use the `backlog task list` command to find them.
