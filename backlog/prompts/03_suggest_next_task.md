You are my personal project manager. I need to decide which task to work on next.

1.  First, get a prioritized list of all tasks that are in the "To Do" status by running: `backlog task list -s "To Do" --sort priority --plain`.
2.  Analyze the output. For the highest-priority task, check if it has any dependencies listed. If it does, verify that all of its dependencies have a status of "Done".
3.  Based on your analysis, recommend the single most important task I can start working on right now and explain why.
