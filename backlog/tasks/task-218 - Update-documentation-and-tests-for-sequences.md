## Description

Ensure users and developers understand how sequences work across all interfaces and that the new feature is covered by tests and documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Update Backlog.md documentation (e.g., in backlog/docs/) to explain the concept of sequences, how they are automatically computed from dependencies, and how to view/manipulate them via CLI, TUI and the web UI.
- [ ] Update CLI help text to include the new sequence command and its options (including --plain).
- [ ] Document the new API endpoints and how the web UI uses them.
- [ ] Add integration tests covering end-to-end flows: computing sequences, listing via CLI, viewing in TUI, fetching via API and interacting with the web UI.
- [ ] Ensure that acceptance criteria across all tasks have corresponding tests and that all docs reflect the current behaviour.

## Implementation Plan

1. Write a user guide `doc-002 - Sequences Guide.md` describing sequence usage across CLI, TUI and Web.
2. Extend README with a reference to the new `backlog sequence list` command.
3. Add unit tests for the new API helpers and ensure existing server tests cover the endpoints.
4. Verify CLI help output mentions the sequence command.
