## Description

The Backlog.md web interface lacks a favicon, making it harder to identify in browser tabs. Adding a favicon will improve recognition and give the UI a more polished feel.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Favicon is visible in the browser tab when using the web UI
- [ ] Favicon reflects Backlog.md branding
- [ ] Favicon loads consistently across all web UI pages without errors
- [ ] Favicon asset is bundled with the project and served by the web server
