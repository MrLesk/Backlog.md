## Description

Extend the CLI to support adding, removing, checking, and unchecking individual acceptance criteria. This enables granular automation (e.g., CI pipelines) with precise control over acceptance criteria management from command line tools and scripts.

The implementation uses stable markers (`<!-- AC:BEGIN -->` and `<!-- AC:END -->`) to clearly delineate the acceptance criteria section, with each criterion numbered for easy reference (1-based indexing).

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Add new acceptance criteria
backlog task edit 226 --ac "User sees 'Saved' toast within 1s" --ac "Form validates email"

# Remove acceptance criterion by index (1-based)
backlog task edit 226 --remove-ac 2

# Check/uncheck acceptance criteria by index
backlog task edit 226 --check-ac 1
backlog task edit 226 --uncheck-ac 3
```

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 CLI supports adding acceptance criteria with --ac flag (multiple allowed)
- [x] #2 CLI supports removing acceptance criterion by index with --remove-ac
- [x] #3 CLI supports checking acceptance criterion by index with --check-ac
- [x] #4 CLI supports unchecking acceptance criterion by index with --uncheck-ac
- [x] #5 Acceptance criteria use stable markers (AC:BEGIN/AC:END) for reliable parsing
- [x] #6 Each criterion is numbered with #N format for clear indexing (1-based)
- [x] #7 Invalid indexes return clear errors and non-zero exit code
- [x] #8 Multiple operations can be combined in a single command
- [x] #9 Docs and tests updated for all CLI behaviors
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

Implemented CLI acceptance criteria management with stable markers and numbered format. Features include:
- Add new acceptance criteria with --ac flag (can be used multiple times)
- Remove acceptance criterion by index with --remove-ac
- Check/uncheck acceptance criterion by index with --check-ac/--uncheck-ac  
- Automatic migration from old format to stable format
- Full test coverage and documentation updates

Key implementation details:
- Created AcceptanceCriteriaManager class in /src/core/acceptance-criteria.ts
- Updated CLI command parser to handle new flags
- Maintains backward compatibility with old format (auto-migrates when edited)
- 22 passing tests covering all functionality
- TypeScript fully typed and compiled
