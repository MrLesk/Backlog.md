## Description

The statistics dashboard currently takes 15 seconds to load, which creates a poor user experience. This task focuses on optimizing statistics calculation and loading performance through caching, lazy loading, background processing, or other performance improvements to reduce load time to under 3 seconds.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Statistics dashboard loads in under 3 seconds for projects with up to 1000 tasks
- [ ] Loading performance is improved by at least 80% compared to current 15-second baseline
- [ ] Statistics calculations are optimized without losing data accuracy
- [ ] Loading states provide clear progress feedback to users
- [ ] Performance improvements work consistently across different project sizes
