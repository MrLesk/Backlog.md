## Description

- Update `src/guidelines/mcp/overview.md` to point agents to the task-execution and task-creation workflows while reinforcing the "search first" process.
- Clarify the numbering and structure in `src/guidelines/mcp/task-completion.md`, adding explicit guidance for implementation notes used as PR summaries.
- Emphasize in `src/guidelines/mcp/task-execution.md` that tasks must act as the canonical storage for plans and notes.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->
