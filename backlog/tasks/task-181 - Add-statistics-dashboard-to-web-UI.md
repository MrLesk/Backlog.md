## Description

Create a Statistics/Dashboard page in the web UI that displays project overview, task statistics, priority breakdowns, and activity metrics in a visual dashboard format with charts and interactive elements.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Add Statistics/Dashboard page route to web UI
- [x] Create /api/statistics endpoint for project metrics
- [x] Display status distribution with visual charts
- [x] Show priority breakdown with color-coded sections
- [x] Include completion percentage and progress indicators
- [x] Display recent activity timeline
- [x] Add interactive charts and data visualizations
- [x] Show project health metrics and trends
- [x] Include export functionality for statistics
- [x] Add navigation link in side menu
- [x] Use responsive design for mobile and desktop
- [x] Handle loading states and empty project gracefully

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented a comprehensive statistics dashboard for the Backlog.md web UI with the following components:

**Backend Implementation:**
- Added `/api/statistics` endpoint in `src/server/index.ts` that reuses the existing CLI statistics logic from `src/core/statistics.ts`
- The endpoint calculates real-time statistics including task counts, completion percentages, recent activity, and project health metrics
- Proper error handling and JSON serialization of Map objects for web consumption

**Frontend Implementation:**
- Created `src/web/components/Statistics.tsx` - a comprehensive React dashboard component
- Added routing support in `src/web/App.tsx` and `src/server/index.ts` for `/statistics` path
- Enhanced `src/web/lib/api.ts` with `fetchStatistics()` method for API communication

**Navigation Integration:**
- Added Statistics navigation link to `src/web/components/SideNavigation.tsx` 
- Included both expanded and collapsed sidebar states with proper icons
- Statistics link appears in main navigation alongside Tasks, Drafts, etc.

**Dashboard Features:**
- **Key Metrics Cards**: Total tasks, completed tasks, completion percentage, and draft count with color-coded icons
- **Progress Visualization**: Animated progress bar showing overall project completion
- **Status Distribution**: Visual breakdown of tasks by status (To Do, In Progress, Done) with percentages and mini charts
- **Priority Breakdown**: Color-coded priority distribution (High: red, Medium: yellow, Low: blue, None: gray)
- **Recent Activity**: Lists of recently created and updated tasks with timestamps and status indicators
- **Project Health**: Shows average task age, stale tasks (>30 days old), and blocked tasks with dependencies
- **Export Functionality**: JSON export button to download complete statistics data

**Design & UX:**
- Fully responsive design working on mobile and desktop screens
- Dark/light theme support consistent with existing UI
- Loading states with spinner during data fetch
- Error handling with user-friendly error messages
- Interactive elements with hover states and transitions
- Clean card-based layout with consistent spacing and typography

**Technical Details:**
- **Shared Logic Implementation**: Created `Core.loadAllTasksForStatistics()` method that extracts the exact same complex task loading logic used by CLI overview command
- **Eliminates Code Duplication**: Both CLI overview and web statistics now use identical logic for loading tasks, handling remote branches, cross-branch filtering, and conflict resolution
- **Comprehensive Task Loading**: Includes local tasks, completed tasks, remote tasks, with proper deduplication and conflict resolution using the same strategy as CLI
- **Cross-Branch Filtering**: Applies the same cross-branch checking logic to ensure consistent task states across all interfaces
- **Backward Compatibility**: Added property aliases (`filesystem`, `gitOps`) to maintain existing server code compatibility
- **Proper TypeScript typing**: Fixed interface extends issues and readonly array type conflicts
- **Error boundary support and graceful degradation**: Comprehensive error handling throughout the statistics pipeline
- **Performance optimized**: Single API call leverages the same efficient task loading used by CLI with parallel processing
- **Consistent Data**: Web dashboard statistics now match exactly what users see in CLI overview command

**Refactoring Achievement:**
- Successfully eliminated logic duplication between CLI and web interfaces
- CLI overview command now uses `core.loadAllTasksForStatistics()` instead of inline logic
- Web API endpoint uses `core.calculateStatistics()` which internally calls the same shared method
- Both interfaces now guarantee identical statistics regardless of access method

All acceptance criteria have been fulfilled, creating a professional statistics dashboard that provides identical and accurate insights into project progress and health as the CLI overview command.
