- [x] Create /api/statistics endpoint for project metrics
- [x] Display status distribution with visual charts
- [x] Show priority breakdown with color-coded sections
- [x] Include completion percentage and progress indicators

## Implementation Notes

### What's New
- Added `/api/statistics` endpoint that reuses CLI logic
- Created `Statistics.tsx` dashboard component with interactive elements
- Added navigation link with trending-up icon
- Tasks in recent activity and project health are clickable to open edit popup

### Key Features
- **Metrics**: Total/completed tasks, completion %, drafts count
- **Visualizations**: Progress bar, status/priority distributions with mini charts
- **Recent Activity**: Clickable recently created/updated tasks
- **Project Health**: Compact summary with avg age, stale/blocked task indicators
- **Loading**: Realistic progress messages (2s intervals) matching CLI experience

### Technical Implementation
- **Shared Logic**: `Core.loadAllTasksForStatistics()` eliminates CLI/web duplication
- **Data Consistency**: Same task loading, cross-branch checking, conflict resolution as CLI
- **Performance**: Single API call with parallel processing
- **UX**: Responsive design, dark/light theme support, proper error handling

### Files Changed
- `src/server/index.ts` - API endpoint
- `src/web/components/Statistics.tsx` - main dashboard
- `src/core/backlog.ts` - shared statistics loading logic
- `src/commands/overview.ts` - refactored to use shared logic
