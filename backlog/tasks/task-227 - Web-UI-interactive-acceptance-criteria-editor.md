## Description

In the web UI task popup, provide a dedicated, user-friendly interface for Acceptance Criteria: show them as an editable checklist with checkboxes, per-item add and remove controls, and immediate persistence to the task markdown. This enhances the user experience by making acceptance criteria management more intuitive and interactive.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] #3 Users can toggle a criterion done/undone from the UI and it persists
- [ ] #4 Markdown is updated using checkboxes without reformatting other sections
- [ ] #5 Docs and tests updated for UI behaviors
