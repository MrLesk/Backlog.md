## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Implement bidirectional synchronization between Jira tickets and local markdown files in Backlog.md, using the MCP Atlassian server for all Jira API interactions. Users can import Jira issues, sync changes bidirectionally, and resolve conflicts when both systems are modified.

- [ ] #5 Auto-check triggers after 5+ minutes of inactivity on edited files
- [ ] #6 Web UI shows sync status with action buttons
- [ ] #7 All operations are tracked in sync state database
