## Description

Add a Sequences page that fetches data from the server and displays sequences vertically with clear labeling.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Sequences page reachable from navigation
- [x] #2 Displays sequences from server with task titles
- [x] #3 Handles empty/large datasets gracefully
- [x] #4 Page renders Unsequenced bucket first (when present), then numbered sequences
- [x] #5 Handles large/empty datasets; no layout jitter when Unsequenced is absent
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

Added sequences page listing from server
