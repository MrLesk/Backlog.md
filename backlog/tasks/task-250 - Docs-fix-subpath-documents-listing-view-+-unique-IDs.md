## Description

Follow-up to GitHub issue #318. Documents created under subdirectories of backlog/docs are not included in `backlog doc list`, and `backlog doc view` cannot open them. Also, when remote operations are disabled or there is no git remote history, ID generation ignores subdirectories and may create duplicate doc IDs.

Goal: Support documents stored in subdirectories end-to-end (list, view, ID generation) with global, sequential IDs across the entire docs tree, both online and offline.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 backlog doc list --plain includes documents from all subdirectories under backlog/docs (recursive) and lists them consistently.
- [ ] #2 backlog doc view (by ID) opens a document correctly even when it resides in a subdirectory.
- [ ] #3 Creating docs with backlog doc create -p <path> produces globally unique, sequential IDs across the entire docs tree, including when remoteOperations=false/offline.
- [ ] #4 Use recursive traversal for docs in: filesystem listDocuments, CLI doc list (interactive and plain), and CLI doc view.
- [ ] #5 Add tests covering: (a) recursive listing with subdirectories, (b) ID generation offline with subdir docs present, (c) view by id for a subdir doc.
- [ ] #6 Update docs explaining that document IDs are global across subdirectories and provide examples with -p and nested paths.
