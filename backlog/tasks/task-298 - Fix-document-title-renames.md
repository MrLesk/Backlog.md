## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Document updates currently mutate the cached document and rewrite using the new title without removing the previous file, leaving duplicate markdown files on rename.
Ensure the server updates document titles safely and filesystem writes handle renames atomically.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Updating a document title through the web UI results in a single markdown file whose name matches the new title.
- [x] #2 Document updates accept JSON payloads with optional title data and avoid mutating the in-memory store unless the write succeeds.
- [x] #3 Add automated coverage (unit or integration) that fails if an old document file remains after a title change.
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Update the document update endpoint to accept JSON payloads, clone the fetched document, and apply title/content changes before persistence.
2. Extend filesystem.saveDocument to detect filename changes (including subdirectories), remove/rename stale files for the same doc id, and then write the new content.
3. Ensure the content store refreshes documents only after a successful write so the cache stays in sync.
4. Add regression tests covering title rename flows (server + filesystem) and verifying the old file is removed.
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
- Updated document update flow to accept JSON payloads, clone the in-memory record, and persist via `core.updateDocument` without mutating cache on failure.
- Reworked filesystem document writes to track relative paths, perform rename semantics, and prune stale duplicates so Git detects renames.
- Added regression tests covering filesystem cleanup, git rename detection, and relative-path metadata to guard against future regressions.
- Verified with targeted test runs (`bun test src/test/filesystem.test.ts src/test/core.test.ts`) and manual rename, staging shows `R` status.
