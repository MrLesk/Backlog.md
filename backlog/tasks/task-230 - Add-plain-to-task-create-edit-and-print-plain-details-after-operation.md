## Description

Implement `--plain` flag for `backlog task create`  and `backlog task edit`. When provided, after the operation completes successfully, print the task content in the same plain-text format as `backlog task <task-id> --plain` â€” including the leading `File:` line pointing to the task file and the structured sections (Status, Created, Description, Acceptance Criteria, etc.).

Context: We already support `--plain` for viewing tasks and drafts. Bringing this to create/edit improves shell scripting and AI agent integrations by returning the final task content immediately.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Running: backlog task create "Example" --desc "Hello" --plain prints plain-text details of the created task using the existing formatter
- [ ] #2 Output begins with 'File: <path>' and includes 'Task task-<id> - <title>', Status, Created, Description, Acceptance Criteria sections
- [ ] #3 Running: backlog task edit <id> -s "In Progress" --plain prints the updated task in plain-text format after saving
- [ ] #5 Tests cover both create/edit flows with --plain and assert 'File:' line, key sections, and absence of TUI escape codes
- [ ] #6 Successful runs exit with code 0; behavior works with --desc alias and other supported flags
