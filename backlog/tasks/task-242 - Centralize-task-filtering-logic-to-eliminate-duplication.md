## Description

Both the CLI task list command and the web server handlers implement their own task filtering by status and assignee. This duplication suggests the need for a shared filtering utility or an extension to FileSystem.listTasks that accepts filter criteria so both interfaces can reuse the logic.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Filtering by status and assignee is centralized in a shared helper or FileSystem API
- [x] #2 CLI task list uses the shared filtering mechanism
- [x] #3 Server task listing uses the shared filtering mechanism
- [x] #4 Unit tests cover filtering for status and assignee
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

Centralized task filtering by status and assignee in FileSystem.listTasks(filter). Updated CLI task list and server task listing to reuse shared filtering. Added unit tests covering status and assignee filters. All tests pass.
