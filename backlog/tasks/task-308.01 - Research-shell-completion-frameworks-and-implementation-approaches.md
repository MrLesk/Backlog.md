## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Research available completion frameworks and patterns to determine the best implementation approach for backlog CLI.

Evaluate:
- Commander.js built-in completion support
- Third-party libraries (omelette, tabtab, etc.)
- Manual shell-specific completion scripts
- Completion generation tools

Document findings and recommend the best approach considering maintainability, cross-shell support, and dynamic completion needs.
