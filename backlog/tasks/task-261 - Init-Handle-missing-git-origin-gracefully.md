## Description

Currently, initialization fails when remote-branch features are enabled but the repository has no git remotes (e.g., no "origin"). Add a preflight check that inspects the current repository before any remote operations (fetch, list remote branches, push). If no remotes exist, skip remote-dependent steps and proceed in local-only mode with a clear, actionable message.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Init works in a repo with no git remotes (no origin) without crashing
- [x] #2 Remote-dependent steps are guarded by a preflight check and are skipped when no remotes exist
- [x] #3 User sees a clear message like: ‘No git remotes detected; skipping remote operations’
- [x] #4 Behavior with remotes present remains unchanged (no regression)
- [x] #5 Preflight helper is reused by init and any other remote-using code paths
- [x] #6 Tests cover no-remote scenario; type-check and lint pass
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Add git remote preflight helper in GitOperations (hasAnyRemote/hasRemote)
2. Guard fetch: skip with clear warning when no remotes exist
3. Short-circuit remote-branch listing when no remotes exist
4. Update code paths that call fetch implicitly (doc/decision ID, remote loader) to rely on guarded fetch
5. Add tests: fetch with no remotes, loadRemoteTasks no-remote, CLI init in no-remote repo
6. Run type-check, lint, tests; ensure all pass

## Implementation Notes

Implemented git remote preflight for all remote operations.

Summary
- Added GitOperations.hasAnyRemote()/hasRemote() helpers
- Guarded GitOperations.fetch() to skip when no remotes exist with clear warning
- Short-circuited listRemoteBranches/listRecentRemoteBranches when no remotes
- Relied on guarded fetch in doc/decision ID generation and remote loader
- Added tests: no-remote preflight (fetch/log), loadRemoteTasks no-remote, CLI init in no-remote repo
- Ran type-check, lint, and full test suite (all pass)
