## Description

Our current flake.nix runs 'bun install' inside the Nix build. Nix builds run without internet access, so trying to download tailwindcss and other dependencies in the build causes a 'connection refused' error. We want to refactor the Nix packaging so that dependencies are fetched in a separate, fixed-output derivation (as demonstrated in the GitHub issue), then copied into the build. This will allow 'nix build' and 'nix run' to succeed offline.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The Nix flake uses a separate derivation to build node_modules and defines outputHash values for each supported platform. The main derivation copies this folder instead of running 'bun install'
- [ ] nix build succeeds in a clean sandbox (no network access) and produces a working backlog binary
- [ ] nix run . -- --version prints the CLI version without errors on supported platforms
- [ ] Documentation in README or a scripts/ helper explains how to update the node_modules hashes when dependencies change
