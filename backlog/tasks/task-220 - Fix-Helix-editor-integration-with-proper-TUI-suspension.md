## Description

Fix critical issue with Helix editor integration in Backlog.md TUI where editor sessions caused screen corruption and input conflicts. The blessed TUI screen wasn't properly suspended when launching external editors, resulting in overlapping displays, unresponsive interface, and performance issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Helix editor launches cleanly without TUI screen overlap
- [x] No background input processing during editor sessions
- [x] UI displays correctly after returning from editor
- [x] Interface remains responsive after editor sessions
- [x] Editor performance is not degraded
- [x] Solution works in Kanban board context
- [x] Solution works in task viewer context
- [x] All existing tests continue to pass
- [x] Works with multiple terminal editors (Helix, vim, etc.)

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze blessed TUI suspension issues and root causes
2. Design proper event listener preservation strategy
3. Implement centralized editor integration method
4. Add comprehensive screen clearing and restoration
5. Update all UI contexts to use centralized method
6. Test with multiple editors and UI states
7. Verify no regression in existing functionality

## Implementation Notes

**Root Cause Analysis:**
Blessed screen wasn't properly suspended when launching external editors, causing:
1. Input event listeners remained active during editor sessions
2. Screen buffer corruption when transitioning between TUI and editor
3. Improper blessed screen state management

**Approach Taken:**
1. **Proper Input Isolation**: Save and restore blessed's event listeners instead of destructively removing them
2. **Clean Screen Transitions**: Added comprehensive screen clearing and layout recalculation after editor sessions  
3. **Centralized Editor Integration**: Created core.openEditor() method for consistent handling across all UI contexts
4. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Proper restoration guaranteed even on editor failures

**Technical Decisions:**
- Enhanced suspend/restore pattern for blessed TUI applications
- Event listener preservation using Map storage
- Screen buffer clearing with clearRegion() and resize event emission
- Works in all contexts: Kanban board, task viewer, popup states

**Modified Files:**
- src/core/backlog.ts - Added centralized openEditor() method
- src/ui/board.ts - Updated to use centralized editor method  
- src/ui/task-viewer.ts - Updated to use centralized editor method

**Testing Results:**
- All 448 existing tests pass
- Editor integration now works seamlessly with Helix, vim, and other terminal editors
- No input conflicts or UI corruption
