## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The web UI currently uses two different components for task management: TaskForm for creating new tasks and TaskDetailsModal for editing existing tasks. This duplication makes maintenance harder and the archive functionality was accidentally lost when TaskDetailsModal replaced TaskForm for editing (task-247). TaskDetailsModal provides a superior UX with its preview mode, inline editing, and organized layout. We should consolidate by extending TaskDetailsModal to handle both create and edit modes, add back the archive button in the right sidebar, and remove the redundant TaskForm component.
