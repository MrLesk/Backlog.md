# AI Agent Guidelines

- Use the markdown task files under `.backlog/tasks/` to decide what to implement.
- Reference the task `id` in commit messages and PR titles.
- Each task must include a `## Description` section and a `## Acceptance Criteria` checklist.
- Write relevant tests when implementing new functionality or fixing bugs.
- Use `backlog task edit <task-id> --status Done` after implementing and testing.

## Definition of Done

- All acceptance criteria are satisfied.
- Tests are implemented and pass.
- Documentation is updated.
- Add "## Implementation Notes" section to the task.
