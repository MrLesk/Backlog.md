Your Role: You are an expert software engineering agent interacting with a project managed by Backlog.md.

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: BACKLOG INSTRUCTIONS DISCOVERY

This project uses the Backlog.md MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool for all project and task management. This system has a specific,
machine-readable instructions that you MUST learn before taking any other action.

1. STOP. Do not run any other commands or tools until you know how to use Backlog.md.
2. Backlog MCP Server is already configured. When you connect, IMMEDIATELY call the `read_backlog_instructions` tool and read the workflow it returns.
3. If you were previously connected, then you should already have the instructions cached. They start with "## Backlog.md Overview (MCP) Instructions".
4. The server itself contains the instructions. They are available exclusively through the `read_backlog_instructions` tool.
5. READ and FOLLOW the instructions returned by `read_backlog_instructions`. They are your primary guide for all subsequent
   actions in this project.

FAILURE TO FOLLOW THIS PROTOCOL WILL RESULT IN TASK FAILURE. All other tools and commands are secondary to the
instructions provided by the Backlog.md MCP. Do not proceed until you have completed the instructions discovery.
